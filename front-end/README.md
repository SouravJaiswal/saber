Notations
=========

I've wrapped some text like this:

```
``` some text ```
```
That means either an icon is needed there or the text is badly formatted or the link is broken.

*Do you have any other way to highlight broken links??* Do we need to name our html files with the `.html` suffix? There's no problem with links on my machine when I tested it.

You can keep that `nav-bar` smart-visible right?

There are some links which are valid but cannot be accesed now. For example those that lead to the Game Spec, leaderboard etc. Do we have to add those links later or is there a way to catch the, redirect them to a popup or a page? Such links I have tried to mark with

```
$%$ some text $%$
```

We have to find out how to render latex on our pages. See [specs.html](website/specs.html)

Others
------

The `RULES EXPLORE SCHEDULE` icons need a change, I'm sure you have a lot at your disposal.
Can that `LEARN MORE` text be modified?

I need those arrow icons in the carousel: `REGISTER ... SHARE`.

News cannot be a carousel. Is there anything else in the theme? Lets use this image for backdrop. I don't know how to add it!

Update all `Contact Us` links to the footer that already exists.

New Pages
=========

```
rules
specs
calendar
downloads
explore
```

`Countdown`, add if easy!

Pre-Release 0.1
===============
I just wished they allowed us to use a framework. Making site-wide changes is slow and annoying!

`NOKTIRNE` brand image must be replaced with `BoB` in any one of the following fonts, color that strikes well with the background:

> I personally favor 3dumb.

**0.** How would a narrow jumbotron look? How would a dark theme suit?

**1.** I want Anokha's Logo to come below `BoB` on the banner. Text that floats over banner should be visible (colour-fix). The text in `<h3>` cannot be capitalised, it should be.. **Suggest banner animation.**

**2.** I want all occurences of `BOB` in the text to be replaced with the font decide from above.

**3.** The `EVENT FLOW` carousel text is center aligned, make it justified! **cool anim possible**

**4.** Removed `DO YOU LIKE WHAT YOU SEE`. Removed location from the contact thing and it got busted! fix that

**5.** Fix footer that copyright thing. `fb icon` looks kike shit, but it can be linked to [https://www.facebook.com/teambob16/](https://www.facebook.com/teambob16/). I changed the template to put that into effect.

**6.** When you move to any other page, `navbar` does not underline current page, but `HOME` **(bug)**

**7.** I want to know how to add `code-boxes`, they are similar to bootstrap `wells` in looks.

**8.** Could not find a bootstrap component for News Feed.

**9.** I want `<h1>` text to be of `condensed type`. Need a better font. Do we have a global site font, or what i see is my default firefox font?

**10.** News

* This [news-demo](http://www.jqueryscript.net/demo/Responsive-jQuery-News-Ticker-Plugin-with-Bootstrap-3-Bootstrap-News-Box/) is good.
* This [plugin,](http://www.jqueryscript.net/text/BBC-News-Like-Website-Ticker-Plugin-with-jQuery-News-Ticker.html) [demo](http://www.jqueryscript.net/demo/BBC-News-Like-Website-Ticker-Plugin-with-jQuery-News-Ticker/) is ok, the colors of this site and its style is really good. Since I lack the know-how to get this, you'll have to do this. I can be on phone all night, discussing colors. Figure out a way where we can quickly share the changes. How about those collaborative file editors? So we can stay on the same page, chat, etc.
